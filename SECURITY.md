# Security Policy

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

## Supported Versions

We support the latest release (v1.0.0+). Older versions may not receive security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Open an issue with **[SECURITY]** in the title (use the bug report template).
- Or email: brainxio@example.com (replace with your actual contact email).
- Include details: version, reproduction steps, impact, and any proof-of-concept code.

We'll acknowledge within 48 hours and work on a fix/release.

## Deps Security

We use `npm audit` in CI. Dependencies are minimal (@actions/core) — report if you find vulns.

## Security Updates

- Security fixes will be released as patch versions (e.g., v1.0.1).
- We'll announce critical fixes via GitHub Releases and issues.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure!
